            <h2>It Happens Here</h2>
            <p>It Happens Here are a student-led society at Newcastle University that campaign against sexual violence
                and harassment, and support student survivors. They have been chosen as participants for this film
                project due to their campaign work on campus. Their previous campaign #DoBetterNCL lead to the
                implementation of mandatory Consent and Actice Bystander training at the university and a reworking of
                support and wellbeing for students.</p><br>

            <h2>Reclaim the Night</h2>
            <p>Reclaim the Night is an annual event held in many different cities across the UK. It started in Leeds during the Yorkshire Ripper murders and before the murderer had been caught. The police implemented a curfew on women in the city and they retaliated with Reclaim the Night.<br> 
                A protest, serving as a reminder than women aren't the problem and therefore the solution doesn't lie with them changing their behaviour. The event still serves the same purpose today, almost 50 years later which shows us that there is still so much to do in the fight for women's rights.</p><br>
