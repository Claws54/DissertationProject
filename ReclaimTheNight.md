# Reclaim the Night
Reclaim the Night is an annual event held in many different cities across the UK. It started in Leeds during the Yorkshire Ripper murders and before the murderer had been caught. The police implemented a curfew on women in the city and they retaliated with Reclaim the Night. A protest, serving as a reminder than women aren't the problem and therefore the solution doesn't lie with them changing their behaviour. 

The event still serves the same purpose today, almost 50 years later which shows us that there is still so much to do in the fight for women's rights.
